# ChordCraft

**ChordCraft** is a generative AI project designed to generate melodies based on textual prompts. The model uses advanced genAI techniques to convert user input into unique melodious Rubab audio files in `.wav` format. This project is aimed at musicians, composers, and anyone interested in exploring the creative possibilities of AI in music.

## Features

- **Text-to-Melody Generation**: Provide a textual prompt and get a corresponding melody.
- **Output in `.wav` format**: High-quality audio files are generated for easy playback and further use.

## Example Audio Samples
