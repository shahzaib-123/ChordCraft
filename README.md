# ChordCraft

**ChordCraft** is a generative AI project designed to generate melodies based on textual prompts. The model uses advanced machine learning techniques to convert user input into unique audio files in `.wav` format. This project is aimed at musicians, composers, and anyone interested in exploring the creative possibilities of AI in music.

## Features

- **Text-to-Melody Generation**: Provide a textual prompt and get a corresponding melody.
- **Output in `.wav` format**: High-quality audio files are generated for easy playback and further use.
  
## Example Audio Samples

Here are some example melodies generated by the model, which can be found in the `generated` directory:

- [Sample 1](flask-server/generated/Ambient&Blues.wav)
- [Sample 2](generated/sample2.wav)
- [Sample 3](generated/sample3.wav)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChordCraft.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ChordCraft
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python generate.py
    ```

## Note

- This repository **does not contain training code** for the model. Only the pre-trained model and its usage for melody generation are provided.
- Generated audio files are saved in `.wav` format.
