# ChordCraft

**ChordCraft** is a generative AI project designed to generate melodies based on textual prompts. The model uses advanced genAI techniques to convert user input into unique melodious Rubab audio files in `.wav` format. This project is aimed at musicians, composers, and anyone interested in exploring the creative possibilities of AI in music.

## Features

- **Text-to-Melody Generation**: Provide a textual prompt and get a corresponding melody.
- **Output in `.wav` format**: High-quality audio files are generated for easy playback and further use.

## Example Audio Samples

Here are some example melodies generated by the model. You can listen to them directly below:

### Sample 1 : Prompt [ Ambient & Blues ]
<audio controls>
  <source src="generated/Ambient&Blues.wav" type="audio/wav">
